# Road Not Taken
[Roblox Group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/4828125/Road-Not-Taken#!/about)

Early work in progress technology demonstration for building a Roblox game entirely with Rojo. It's not a game yet.

This project intends to show off the latest and greatest in Rojo features. It currently requires the current `master` branch of both the CLI and Roblox Studio plugin.

## Goals
- Never check a place file into version control
- Show off current Rojo developments

## Non-goals
- Make a good game

## Bugs found so far
- Refs don't serialize correctly, which makes `Model.PrimaryPart` not work. ([LPGhatguy/rojo#142](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo/issues/142))
