Technology demonstration game managed entirely by Rojo. It's not really a game yet.

This project intends to show off the latest and greatest in Rojo features.

## Building Locally
Requires [Foreman](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/foreman) 1.0+, which will install all other tools.

```bash
foreman install
```

From there, just run `rojo build` and `rojo serve` as usual.

## Goals
- Never check a place file into version control
- Show off latest Rojo features

## Non-goals
- Make a good game

## Status
Foundation for a game is here. Most of my time is spent working on the underlying technology for *Road Not Taken* as opposed to the game itself.

## License
*Road Not Taken* is available under the terms of the MIT license. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.
